<p>What are the social and collective conditions of the artistic practice? Is an artwork the result of a singular encounter between the author and the medium, or is it rather the unfolding of a complex network of social encounters and interactions? While past discourse has tended to emphasise the former – perhaps influenced by the puritanical, modernist ideal of The Artist producing work in gloomy solitude and self-inflicted isolation – contemporary sensibility has shifted to the opposite pole. Now more then ever art thrives on the ability to interact and on the willingness of artists to collaborate and interconnect on a global scale. As “networking” becomes one of the most powerful paradigms for contemporary culture, visual art has adopted it quickly and with ease. Of course there is a long tradition in art history of collaborative practice and artistic bodies that span the globe, DADA and Fluxus being the most prominent examples. Yet the current shift cannot be confined to, or defined by, a single movement: there seems to be a profound and radical shift in the very structure of artistic production and interaction that should be noted an examined with great interest and care.</p></br>
<p>MyPeople aims to embrace this new sensibility: the tendency toward collaboration, collectivity and reinvented social space. It does not strive merely to establish a group of creative individuals exhibiting alongside each other. The project is meant to unleash the network, to free its inner generative forces, to let it unfold from within. We suggest that in order to achieve this the network must disrupt the established structure of artistic projects: it must upset the traditional division of roles that separates artistic practice from the process of curating. In MyPeople each artist takes an active and prominent part in choosing additional contributors. As a result, the expansive, self-generating potential of the network is distributed and shared among its members. The artists, curators, and organisers become equal participants, while the boundaries between their roles remain clear. At the same time, the project, which envisions successive shows in London, Amsterdam and Shanghai, with participation of artists coming from diverse cultural backgrounds, follows another trait of the network, its spatial unravelling, its transcendence of topological singularity. Within the open, self-reproducing network, distances are obliterated; borders become meaningless, hierarchies are disrupted.</p></br>
<p>The ambition of the project MyPeople is not only to examine this structural shift through the featured artwork, and through related activities, such as events, blogs and remote video conferences between the participants. The project – in the way it has been conceived and in the way it continues to grow from within, driven by the collaboration of its participants – itself embodies the metaphor of networking. MyPeople is not only an implementation of practical steps towards enhanced artistic collaboration but, more importantly, it is a reflection upon the radical shift occurring in visual arts and in the whole contemporary culture.</p>
