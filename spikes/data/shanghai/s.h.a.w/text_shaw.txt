Xu Zhifeng a.k.a. Shaw studied architecture at the Fine Art College of Shanghai University between 2003 – 2008. Since this time, Shaw has moved on to explore the theoretical and social experience of architecture through a series of installation, intervention, performance pieces and art exhibitions that intervene with urban spaces, and challenge the observers experience of the built environment. Xu has exhibited extensively in China, UK, and Germany.
