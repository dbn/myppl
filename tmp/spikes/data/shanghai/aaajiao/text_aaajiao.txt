Xu Wenkai, who uses the name Aaajiao in most exhibition and other public contexts, was born in Xi’an in 1984 and currently resides in Shanghai. His name is widely known within both art and tech circles in China, though mostly for his efforts at organizing and sharing information rather than as an artist per se. In his works in general, Aaajiao focuses on the use of data and its various forms of display, and how meaning is understood through the process of transforming the movement from reality, to data, and back again. His most significant aesthetic contribution to new media in China is a social one, acting as a vector for the interpretation and communication of international and local trends in the usages of software in artistic practice.
