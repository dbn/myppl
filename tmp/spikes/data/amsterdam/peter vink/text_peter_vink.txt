Peter Vink (1974) is a Dutch visual artist. He studied Time Based Arts & Design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, Amsterdam from 1997-2001.His works mainly evolve around the concept of an existing space. The place where a work is exhibited is almost always inevitably an important part of the work itself. More often than not, it is even the cause for the art. The place of exhibition isn’t necessarily a place reserved for showing art; it can be anywhere. In the process of making this place more or less becomes the artist’s studio.Generally Peter Vink adds something to the space he is working in in order to stress it’s characteristics.
